    <p><b>Pioneer in Personal Computing Revolution</b><br><hr>
        Steve Jobs' wikipedia page has in its infobox 'known for' = 'pioneer in personal computing revolution'. That's valid, I think it's equally valid in Bill Gates' as they were contemporary rivals that both had undeniably monumental impact in the PC revolution. I don't think Bill Gates' infobox merely saying 'known for' = 'co-founding microsoft' is sufficient to encapsulate what he is actually known for and achieved. While he is absolutely known for this, stating this alone trivializes the specific impact he had and reduces it similarly to any future CEO of Microsoft being known for merely their association to the company.
        
        Is there any reason we don't have this information in the infobox like Steve Jobs'? Codeconjurer777 (talk) 13:27, 11 January 2024 (UTC)
        
        I would say it's because Jobs has the benefit of fandom, and such redundant puffery should be removed from his article. 2601:642:4600:D3B0:F80D:4E88:C064:17CB (talk) 00:10, 4 July 2024 (UTC)<br>
        <b>Wealth sub section</b><br><hr>
        Reading through parts of the article, I thought a paragraph under Personal life should be split into another sub section after Wealth, perhaps on the lines of Collection or private collection? As it makes sense to separate his private life facts and memorabilia, considering there is already a section to do with money. Any thoughts? I understand this is a peer reviewed article and all, but there's always room for improvement! Cltjames (talk) 02:38, 27 August 2024 (UTC)

        <b>Public Image Quotes</b><hr>
        Under public image, many quotes are used to describe Gates, but few are directly attributed. I was thinking it was perhaps scare quotes, but it seems we aren't supposed to use them per MOS:Words to watch. It also, of course, is using unsupported attributions, which is also a no-no under MOS:Words to watch. Thanks, Titan(moon)003 (talk) 14:41, 9 November 2024 (UTC)<br>
